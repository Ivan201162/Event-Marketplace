# Windows Build Issue

## E24 - Windows Release Build

**Date:** $(Get-Date)

**Issue:** Windows build failed due to compilation errors in the codebase

**Error Details:**
- Multiple compilation errors in Dart code
- Type mismatches and missing method definitions
- Issues with providers, services, and models
- Build process failed after 168.4 seconds

**Root Cause:** 
The codebase has multiple compilation errors that prevent successful Windows build:
- Missing method definitions (e.g., `getChat` in ChatService)
- Type mismatches (e.g., UserRole type conflicts)
- Missing required parameters in constructors
- Incompatible return types

**Status:** Windows build toolchain is properly installed, but code compilation errors need to be fixed.

**Required Actions:**
- Fix compilation errors in the codebase
- Resolve type mismatches
- Add missing method implementations
- Fix constructor parameter issues

**Next Steps:** 
- Fix all compilation errors first
- Then retry Windows build
- Consider running `flutter analyze` to identify all issues

**Alternative:** Continue with other tasks (E25-E32) and address Windows build after fixing compilation errors.
